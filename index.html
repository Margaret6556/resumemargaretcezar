    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p> I'm a web development ninja, passionate about crafting user-friendly interfaces that are as easy to use as a slice of the pie. I'm good at harmonizing whether HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or React. I'm familiar with all the latest front-end frameworks, from React to Cybersecurity, and I'm always eager to learn more.

<br />
    As an experienced tech startup founder, I was the mastermind for all things front-end and back-end. I worked closely with the design and developer team to turn my visions into reality and ensured our projects were pixel-perfect. I'm a team player who's not afraid to roll up my sleeves and get my hands dirty. Whether debugging code, optimizing website performance, or crafting user-friendly interfaces, I'm always up for a challenge.
<br />
I am a multi-passionate and multi-skilled generalist with a wide range of experience in Marketing, Product & Engineering, Accounting, and Legal domains. I have a Bachelor's degree and am a self-motivated entrepreneur passionate about technology.  My greatest strength is my ability to improve processes where possible, and I am proactive, a fast learner, and highly organized. I am open to joining a technical team, working with A-team players, and solving challenging and impactful cases.
